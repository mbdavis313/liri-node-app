### Statement of completion

Student utilized Node.js, Axios, and Spotify API to create an interactive command line application. A link to the repository has been included in the homework submission

Note: COMMENT each block of your code, especially the code learned in this week's class. Describe what the code does and cite the source, noting where you found the code. Failure to do so will result in a full letter grade deduction.

### Grade: A - complete, functional, and follows best practices

If the student's assignment was complete, functional, and polished, assign an A.

### Grade: B - complete, functional, does not follow all best practices

If the student's assignment had a few areas that could be improved, assign a B and provide specific feedback. Reasons for a B grade include any one of the following:

* Programs that work correctly, but only under certain conditions or test cases.

* Programs that are complete and fully usable despite having some code that doesn't work correctly.

* Programs that completely work but don't follow best practices such as good variable naming conventions, avoiding deep nesting, avoiding long and complex expressions and string concatenations.

* Not neatly indenting or fomatting code, either manually, with a plugin like Prettier, or using a site like Dirty Markup.

* Not using ES6 like let and const where appropriate.

* If the project includes HTML or CSS, they should pass the w3c validator. Libraries used like Bootstrap do not need to pass the validator.

* Program doesn't follow best practices for accessibility taught in class, like using the alt attribute for images.

* The git README file is incomplete.

### Grade: C - partially complete and functional

If there is code that doesn't work or doesn't reflect understanding of the week's course concepts, assign a C and offer further assistance. Reasons for a C grade include:

* Any one of the 9 steps listed in the instructions is not completed or working correctly.

* Any one of the 3 commands listed in the instructions is not completely handled or working correctly.

* The wrong repository link was submitted with the homework.

* If the work is supposed to be published on Github projects or another server, the correct link must be submitted with the homework.

### Grade: D - minimally complete and functional

If the majority of the project is not complete or functional, assign a D grade and invite the student to visit office hours for help. Reasons for a D grade include:

* Only a few instructions were followed and something works, but not the majority of the features.

* Nothing works, though a clear effort was made and comments and/or pseudo code was included for the majority of the steps.

### Grade: F - does not work

If the student submitted a homework but nothing works or functions, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade and invite them to visit office hours for help.

### Empty Repository (I)

Students should receive this grade **only** if they submit an empty repository. If the student attempted the homework assignment and was simply unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a normal letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.

### Notes

* In order to test/grade this assignment without students pushing up their `.env` file and API keys, copy the [.env](../Solutions/.env) file from the hw solution to the assignment to be graded.

**Good Luck!**
